+++ abstract = "An omnidirectional image (ODI) enables viewers
to look in every direction from a fixed point through a headmounted
display providing an immersive experience compared
to that of a standard image. Designing immersive virtual reality
systems with ODIs is challenging as they require high resolution
content. In this paper, we study super-resolution for ODIs and
propose an improved generative adversarial network based model
which is optimized to handle the artifacts obtained in the
spherical observational space. Specifically, we propose to use a
fast PatchGAN discriminator, as it needs fewer parameters and
improves the super-resolution at a fine scale. We also explore
the generative models with adversarial learning by introducing
a spherical-content specific loss function, called 360-SS. To train
and test the performance of our proposed model we prepare a
dataset of 4500 ODIs. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method and identify new challenges in ODI superresolution
for future investigations."
