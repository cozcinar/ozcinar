abstract= "Understanding visual attention has always been a topic of great interest in the graphics, image/video processing, robotics and human-computer interaction communities. By understanding salient image regions, the compression, transmission and rendering algorithms can be optimized. This is particularly important in omnidirectional images (ODIs) viewed with a head-mounted display (HMD), where only a fraction of the captured scene is displayed at a time, namely viewport. In order to predict salient image regions, saliency maps are estimated either by using an eye tracker to collect eye fixations during subjective tests or by using computational models of visual attention. However, eye tracking developments for ODIs are still in the early stages and although a large list of saliency models are available, no particular attention has been dedicated to ODIs. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the problem of estimating saliency maps for ODIs viewed with HMDs, when the use of an eye tracker device is not possible. We collected viewport center trajectories (VCTs) of 32 participants for 21 ODIs and propose a method to transform the gathered data into saliency maps. The obtained saliency maps are compared in terms of image exposition time used to display each ODI in the subjective tests. Then, motivated by the equator bias tendency in ODIs, we propose a post-processing method, namely fused saliency maps (FSM), to adapt current saliency models to ODIs requirements. We show that the use of FSM on current models improves their performance by up to 20%. The developed database and testbed are publicly available with this paper."
